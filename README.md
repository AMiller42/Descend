# Descend

Descend is a flavor of Markdown designed to be golfy. Markdown is typically a very readable form of text formatting, but sometimes it can seem bulky and unwieldy. I wanted to create a flavor of Markdown that didn't have that problem. Also I was bored. Besides the short syntax, one of the main features of Descend is a built-in, JS-like scripting language, designed to easily fit together with the Markdown features of Descend to create a cohesive and usable formatting experience.

This is a temporary branch to share an example of Descend Markdown and show how it is translated to HTML. This is a very early draft, and most of it is subject to change. The most likely to change is the scripting portion, since that part of the language hasn't been specced yet. The current implementation in the HTML is just some hacked together example JS, so no judgement, mkay?

If you want to try out the HTML, make sure to download the `example.js` file and put it in the same folder as the `example.html` file.
